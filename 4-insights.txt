Exploratory Data Analysis Insights : 
* Total records = 50
* No missing values
* Passenger range = 51 to 148
* Load ratio (max) = 1.60 ->shows overcrowding

About Routes:
* Each of the 5 routes (R11 to R15) had exactly 10 trips
* This gives a balanced distribution for comparison
* Proceeding to analyze avg. delay, load, and passenger per route

Trip Frequency by Weekdays:
* Wednasday and Thursday - Highest(10 trips each)
* Firday to Monday - Lowest(5 trips each)
  Suggestions:
  * Mid-week days may require better buss readiness & load management
  * Firday to Monday trend can be revalidated with more data before reducing services

Most frequent delays:
* 6 trips had no delays(0 mins)
* 6 trips had 8-minutes delay
* less frequent but existings delays of 11 , 4 , and 16 minutes.
  Suggestions:
  * Investigate why this 8-minutes delay occur regularly
  * Consider slight scheduling changes or buffer time.
  
Routes and Delays :
* R14 has an average delay of 11.2 minutes, which is significantly higher than R11(4.3 mins).
This suggest R14 needs specific rescheduling and route optimization.
